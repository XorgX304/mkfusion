Segments that needs more work:

* cfexpression to c++ source code -> qcfgenerator.cpp/h
* exceptions                      -> qmkfusionexception.cpp/h
* cffunctions                     -> cffunctions.cpp/h
* cftags                          -> need to rethink how is the best practice for files location
* udf/cfc                         -> new feature
* Application, Session scope      -> new feature
